After the questions
Pops handed me a little tea, sleep and a blessing, uh
Feet keeping me warm
Tucked in the sheets with a mattress and bedding, uh
Laughed at the answers he gave
Like he was a pastor or something
He knew what I seeked
News of the week, I was weak, yeah
But now I'm strong you should test me
The worlds fucked up past fixing
The motor is old and the pistons are pissed they ain't pressing
And me
I've missed one too many chances to win I ain't losing the drive
I'm invested
Despite all the answers I lack
There's a purpose I'm cursed, pursuit till I'm breathless
Yeah
A van and a press kit, manager, bed and a breakfast, a band a set list
I took a moment to breathe
Head first I jumped in the sea
With wet clothes and dry jokes
I spoke on to thee
Heavy I sway with the breeze
Stumbling over my feet
I took a walk
So in this argument now who's who and
The point of It all is for nothing, shhh
Please keep quiet I've explained all the
Quirks I am true I am here you can love me
But
For the meantime the least you could
Do is know that our problems are nothing
And
Your nation is dangerous,
The way that they blame other races for suffering
The earth still spins on it's axis -
Fuck man, that has to mean something
